### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. One of the first concepts I learned about was AJAX. AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. It allows you to load data from
the server without a browser page refresh. One of the benefits of AJAX is it allows for creating better, faster,
and more interactive web applications with the help of JavaScript, HTML, and more.
2. The second concept I learned about is JSON, also known as JavaScript Object Notation. It is a lightweight text-based open standard designed for human-readable data interchange. Its main purpose is to transmit data between a server and web applications. 
3. The third concept I learned about is the API key, also known as application programming interface key. This key acts as both a unique identifier and a secret token for authentication. 
4. The fourth concept I learned is how to to use the JavaScript Console to troubleshoot your Web Application. You start by previewing the index.html. You then click the Network tab in the JavaScript Console. Lastly, you select the last entry and review the Response tab to determine if you are properly retrieving the HTTP response. 
5. The last concept I learned more about was Bootstrap. The Bootstrap framework has several pre-built styles that are created to make a resposnive application. An example is the jumbotron which displays the application title.
